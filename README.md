# Is Mastodon Actually Better than Twitter? - A Closer Look at Privacy Policies 

On October 27th, 2022, Elon Musk closed a $44 billion deal to purchase Twitter and officially took over one of the major social media platforms in the world. With Musk’s mixed reputation in the technology space as well as his vision for the platform, his leadership alarmed many users as Elon Musk has heavily focused on profit and free speech over user’s trust and safety. In search of an alternative, users sought out a similar platform called Mastodon. Mastodon is a social media platform that was founded in 2016 by the software developer Eugen Rochko. Mastodon claims that it can be a “viable alternative to Twitter” as a free and open source platform where communication is not dictated by one commercial company. Its users have grown significantly since Musk's takeover of Twitter.

Considering the significance of privacy and data, this paper aims to compare the privacy policies of Twitter and its alternative, Mastodon. The hypothesis for this paper is that Matsudon is a better social media platform than Twitter, therefore Mastodon must have a good if not a better privacy policy than Twitter.
